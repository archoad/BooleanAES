BooleanAES
==========

Set of programs for generating Boolean equation of the mini-AES and the AES.

# Boolean functions

## boolean_stats.py

This script generates graphs displaying the distribution of randomly generated Boolean functions.

Launch with the command:

>./boolean_stats.py

# mini-AES

## miniaes_equa.py

This script implements the mini-AES algorithm in Python. We can use it for tests.

Launch with the command:

>./miniaes_equa.py

## miniaes_stats.py

This script generates graphs displaying the distribution of Boolean functions of the mini-AES.

Launch with the command:

>./miniaes_stats.py

# AES-128

##  aes_equa.py

This script implements the AES algorithm in Python. It generates the Boolean equations of the AES.

Launch with the command:

>./aes_equa.py

At the end of the code (in main function) there is some options to generate boolean functions.

## aes_stats.py

This script generates graphs displaying the distribution of Boolean functions of the AES.

Launch with the command:

>./aes_stats.py
